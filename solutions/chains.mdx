Relay is designed to make transacting across chains as fast, cheap, and reliable as online payments. Relay is designed for rapid chain expansion. For chains, getting Relay means:

**[Instant Onboarding](/use-cases/bridging)** - Relay support of your chain means users can instantly onboard onto your chain from any supported network and currency. You can leverage the API to build your own onboarding experience or use our [UI Kit] to quickly build onboarding for your app.

**[Same and Cross-chain Swaps](/use-cases/cross-chain-swaps)** - Relay's [Any-to-Any Swaps](/use-cases/cross-chain-swaps) means that once your chain is supported, users across the Relay ecosystem will be able to do any-to-any swaps on your network.
