Relay is designed to make transacting across chains as fast, cheap, and reliable as online payments. There are several core use cases of Relay that make it a great choice for both self-custodial wallets and wallet/account infrastructure providers.

## How To Use Relay

**[Onboarding](/use-cases/bridging)** - Using Relay, wallets and wallet providers can allow users to instantly onboard crypto from any currency on any chain. This means you can source users from all major networks, and get them into your wallet in two seconds.

**[In Wallet Swaps & Bridging](/use-cases/cross-chain-swaps)** - Relay supports bridging, same-chain swaps, and cross-chain swaps through a unified [Quote API](/references/api/get-quote). This allows wallets to embed bridging and swaps directly into the wallet exprience. We couple instant cross-chain routing via the Relay Network with meta-aggregation of the best onchain swap providers to give your users great prices, instant exchange across chains, and quick quotes.

**[Chain Abstraction](/use-cases/calling)** - Relay is designed to enable multichain transaction execution, which we call _multichain call execution_. That means that your users can pay for any transactions on any chain with currency on any other. In the context of wallets this is particularly useful for chain abstraction use cases and products. We have broad support for smart wallet types, including 4337 & 7702. Learn more about [Smart Wallet Support]().
