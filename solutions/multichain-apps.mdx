Relay is designed to make transacting across chains as fast, cheap, and reliable as online payments. If you are a multichain app, there are several key ways to use Relay.

## How to Use Relay

**[Onboarding](/use-cases/bridging)** - If your app uses an embedded wallet, you can use Relay to instantly onboard crypto from any currency on any chain. This means you can source users from all major networks, and get them into your wallet in two seconds.

**[In App Swaps & Bridging](/use-cases/cross-chain-swaps)** - Relay's [Any-to-Any Swaps](/use-cases/cross-chain-swaps) allows apps to embed bridging and swaps. We couple instant cross-chain routing via the Relay Network with meta-aggregation of the best onchain swap providers to give your users great prices, instant exchange across chains, and quick quotes.

**[Cross-chain Checkout](/use-cases/calling)** - Relay is designed to enable multichain transaction execution, which we call _multichain call execution_. That means that your users can pay for any transactions on any chain with currency on any other. This enables a cross-chain checkout experience for your users, giving you broader access to their preferred payment methods and minimizing drop off due to lack of funds.

**[Chain Abstraction](/use-cases/calling)** - Relay is designed to enable full chain abstraction. This allows teams to build full centralized exchange trading experiences with onchain rails.

## Relay Benefits

**Chain Support** - Relay supports [85+ chains](/references/api/api_resources/supported-chains), offering coverage across all major EVM networks, alt L1s, SVMs and many appchains.
