When calling the `/quote` endpoint, various errors may be returned depending on request conditions, user input, or internal routing logic. This guide outlines the possible error codes, their meanings, and how to handle them.

## Expected Errors

These are known validation and routing issues that developers should gracefully handle in their integrations:

| Error Code                                    | Message                                                                     | Description                                                           |

## Unexpected Errors

| Error Code                       | Description                                                               |
