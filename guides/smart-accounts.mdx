description: "Learn about ERC-4337 and EIP-7702 — the two evolving standards that power smart account functionality in Ethereum and Relay"
---

Smart accounts are a powerful upgrade over traditional Ethereum accounts. They enable programmable features that go far beyond simple ETH transfers or contract calls. With smart accounts, you can:

- ✅ **Batch multiple actions** into one atomic transaction (e.g. approve + swap)
- ⛽ **Sponsor gas** for users, enabling gasless or ERC-20-fee flows
- 🔐 **Add access control**, session keys, or 2FA to secure user actions
- 🔄 **Delegate execution** while keeping the original user as `msg.sender`
- 🌉 **Execute logic across chains** with origin-to-destination coordination

Together, these features unlock smoother user experiences, more expressive apps, and safer account management.

Relay supports two complementary standards that make this possible:

---

### 🔹 [ERC-4337](./erc-4337)

ERC-4337 introduces a new abstraction layer built around **UserOperations**, a custom mempool, and smart account contracts. It enables:

- Sponsored transactions via **paymasters**
- Flexible smart account validation logic
- Secure UX patterns like **social recovery**, plugins, and batched workflows

It requires a smart account implementation (e.g. Safe, Kernel) and interaction with bundlers and the EntryPoint contract.

---

### 🔹 [EIP-7702](./eip-7702)

EIP-7702 adds a new transaction type that lets EOAs **become smart contracts**. With a signed `authorizationList`, you can:

- Execute smart contract code **from your existing EOA**
- Keep `msg.sender` equal to the user
- Perform destination-side logic without deploying a smart contract
- Delegate to ERC-4337-compatible logic if needed

No new accounts. No bundlers. Just signatures and seamless smart wallet behavior.

Relay supports both standards across testnets, with EIP-7702 coming to mainnet soon. Whether you're building wallets, gasless dApps, or cross-chain UX flows — smart accounts unlock a new design space.
