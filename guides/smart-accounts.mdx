description: "How Relay uses ERC-4337 and EIP-7702 to enable smart wallet features like gas sponsorship, batching, and cross-chain execution"
---

Smart accounts unlock new design space in **Relayâ€™s cross-chain infrastructure**. With them, we can:

- âœ… **Batch multiple actions** into one atomic call (e.g. deposit â†’ call user wallet â†’ mint NFT)
- ðŸ”„ **Delegate tx execution to the user**, preserving `msg.sender` on the destination chain
- â›½ **Sponsor gas** or use ERC-20s for fee payments
- ðŸŒ‰ **Route logic across chains**, bridging into EOAs that execute contract logic without a separate deployment

Relay supports two complementary standards for smart account execution:

---

### ðŸ”¹ [ERC-4337](./erc-4337)

Relay uses ERC-4337 to support complex smart account flows. Key features include:

- Sponsored transactions using **paymasters**
- Arbitrary smart account validation logic
- **Bundled execution**: approve â†’ swap â†’ send, all in one tx

This is useful when you have smart accounts like **Safe** or **Kernel**, and interact via **UserOperations**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ [EIP-7702](./eip-7702)

Relay uses EIP-7702 to enable **EOAs to become smart accounts**.

We support 7702 to:

- **Execute logic on destination chains where the user is `msg.sender`**  
  Useful for apps where the final contract cares about the actual sender (e.g. NFT mints, purchases)
- **Preserve intent and gas delegation across chains**  
  Our solver can bridge ETH or tokens to the user's EOA, and the EOA can act as a smart wallet
- **Avoid smart account setup** on destination: the user's EOA behaves like a contract temporarily, powered by an `authorizationList` signature

This is **live on testnets** for destination-side execution. Origin-side 7702 support (for gasless flows) is coming next.

### ðŸ§  Why Smart Accounts Matter for Relay

Smart accounts let us overcome key limitations in a cross-chain solver system:

| Problem | Solved By |
|--------|-----------|
| `msg.sender` is solver, but the app needs it to be the user | âœ… ERC-4337 / 7702 |
| Want to batch calls after bridging ETH | âœ… ERC-4337 / 7702 |
| Want to pay gas from any chain or abstract fees entirely | âœ… ERC-4337 paymasters / 7702 signature logic |
| Want smart account functionality for your EOA | âœ… EIP-7702 |

For example, when someone uses ETH on Chain A to buy an NFT on Chain B:

- Relay bridges the ETH to their EOA
- That EOA uses a signed 7702 tx to **batch logic** on Chain B: approve â†’ mint
- `msg.sender` = the user, not Relay

This wasnâ€™t previously possible because we couldnâ€™t inject logic into EOAs **without deploying a contract**. Now we can.
