description: How to Deposit to Solana from an EVM Chain
---

Relay now supports depositing to Solana from any EVM chain we support. This is a great way to 
get users funds on Solana to complete transactions.

There are few things that make depositing to Solana different than another EVM chain. See the information you'll need in the table below.

|  Param  |  Input  |  Description  |
|  `chainId`  | `792703809`  | This is the chainId assigned to access Solana. |
| `recipient`  | User's Solana Address  | This must be a valid Solana address. Do **not** use an Ethereum wallet address, this will not work  |
| `toCurrency`  |  Contract Address of Token  | This must be a valid Solana token address. Do not use an EVM address.  |
