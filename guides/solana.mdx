description: How to Deposit to Solana from an EVM Chain
---

Relay now supports depositing to Solana from any EVM chain we support. This is a great way to 
get users funds on Solana to complete transactions. You can onboard users funds from Blast ETH 
to Solana USDC to make transactions on a game. You could also swap funds from Base Degen to Solana SOL for users to mint.
The possibilities are limitless when you use Relay embedded in your app.

There are few things that make depositing to Solana different than another EVM chain. See the information you'll need in the table below.

| Param        | Input                 | Description                                                                        |
|--------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `chainId`    | `792703809`           | This is the chainId assigned to access Solana for Relay's tools.                                      |
| `recipient`  | User's Solana Address  | This must be a valid Solana address. Do **not** use an Ethereum wallet address.     |
| `toCurrency` | Contract Address of Token | This must be a valid Solana token address. Do **not** use an EVM address.               |

These are the Solana tokens that are currently supported by Relay.
| Token | Token Address | Token Symbol | Decimals |
|-------|---------------|--------------|----------| 
| SOL   | 11111111111111111111111111111111 | SOL | 9 |
| USDC  | EPjFWdd5AufqSSqeM2qN1xzybapC8G4wEGGkZwyTDt1v | USDC | 6 |

## API

Once you have the necessary information, you can start utilizing our API to deposit from 
a supported EVM chain to Solana. To get started, 
check out the [execution steps](/references/api/step-execution) of our API. Then 
when you're ready to swap, head over to the [Get Quote](/references/api/get-quote) API endpoint.

## SDK

You'll need the same information shared in the table to utilize the SDK to swap 
from an EVM chain to Solana. To get started, learn how to set up our [SDK client](/references/sdk/getting-started). 
Afterwards, explore our [getQuote](/references/sdk/actions/getQuote) SDK action to start swapping.
