description: How to Deposit or Withdraw on Solana from an EVM Chain
---

Relay now fully supports depositing & withdrawing to Solana from any EVM chain we support. This is a great way to 
get users funds on Solana to complete transactions. You can onboard users funds from Blast ETH 
to Solana USDC to make transactions on a game. You could also swap funds from Solana SOL to Zora ETH for users to mint.
The possibilities are limitless when you use Relay embedded in your app.

## Required Information

There are few things that make transacting on Solana different than another EVM chain. The provided information 
below should review all the exceptions where your input is Solana specific.

<Warning>Solana wallet addresses are case sensitive. </Warning>

## API

Once you have the necessary information, you can start utilizing our API for full 
Solana withdrawal and deposit support. To get started, 
check out the [execution steps](/references/api/step-execution) of our API. Then 
when you're ready to swap, head over to the [Get Quote](/references/api/get-quote) API endpoint.

## SDK

You'll need the information shared in the tables above to utilize the SDK to deposit or withdraw from Solana.
 To get started, learn how to set up our [SDK client](/references/sdk/getting-started). 
Afterwards, explore our [getQuote](/references/sdk/actions/getQuote) SDK action to start swapping.
