description: 'Learn how to use Relay with a deposit address for instant bridging.'
---

Relay supports instantly and cheaply bridging from a variety of EVM and non-EVM chain to any token. 
We are now launching deposit addresses to allow users to bridge without connecitng a wallet. Users can send funds to a designated address 
and Relay will instantly deposit the correct tokens on the destination chain in the user's wallet. This is a great way for users to quickly 
start transacting on a new chain!

Please note, only brigding is supported with deposit addresses right now. We are working diligently to add swapping support. Please check this page 
or follow our [X](https://x.com/relayprotocol) for the latest updates about this feature.

## How It Works

A deposit address is linked to a single request. There is no pre-generation of deposit address 
required. Currently, re-using a deposit address is not possible. Deposit addresses currently are 
single use only. When using this feature, you will need to make sure `useDepositAddress` is set to 
`true` in the request. You will also need to specify the `refundTo` address. This is the address 
used in case of refunds.

When depositing, the deposit transaction must come from the specified `user` address. If funds are 
received from the wrong `user` address, a refund will be sent to the `refundTo` address.

The deposit transaction requires no calldata. You just need to send the specified value to the  
address specified in the response data. The response data will return you the deposit address 
needed to complete the bridge. 

When using deposit addresses, there are more relayer gas fees associated with bridges. Typically about 
33,000 extra gwei or gas is required than regular bridges. For the smallet bridges, we recommend 
using another method since so much gas is required.

If a deposit takes longer than 30 seconds, a new quote will automatically be generated post-deposit. 
This is done to account fro gas fluctuation. Generating a new quote can change the amount received 
after depositing.

## Edge Cases

To prevent common edge cases, we have protection and logic to prevent this from happening. Any refunds 
will happen automatically and instantly. Some commmon edge casese are described below:
- Depositing to the Wrong Chain -- For example, if the bridge deposit request is on Base but the funds 
are received on Optimism, a refund sent to the `refundTo` address will be quickly and automatically 
dispensed. 
- Double Spend -- We also protect again double spend when the deposit address sends the funds twice. The automatic, instant 
refund will be sent to the `refundTo` address.
- Depositing from the Wrong Address -- The deposit must be received from the specified `user` address. 
If funds are received from the wrong sender, a refund will be despensed to that sender or wrong address. The 
`refundTo` address will not be used in this case.
- Extra Funds are Received -- If the user deposits more funds than what is quoted, a quote will be 
generated post-deposit and the entire amount will be bridged. This is so all funds received are bridged 
and returned to the user. 
- Less Funds are Received -- If the user deposits less funds than what is quoted, a new quote will be generated 
post-deposit and completed. This is to account for the shortage of funds received.


## Limitations

There are a few current limitations though we are working on adding new features to reduce limitations. 
- Only native currency bridging is allowed.
- Calldata execution on destination is not allowed.
- Only exact input brigding is allowed. Specifying exact output will not work.
- When non-native currency (alternative erc20) or NFTs are sent to the deposit address, we 
do not support sending them back or recovering of those assets. We soon will add backwards-compatibility when 
this limitation is removed & feature is launched.
- If funds are sent to the wrong deposit address, there is a likelihood that the wrong address will not be one that Relay has access to. In the 
event that a wrong deposit address is used, we cannot guarantee recovery of sent funds.

## Debugging

When looking up the status of a bridge or fetching the request data, please use the `requestId` and our [Get Execution Status API](/references/api/get-intents-status-v2).
The transaction hash of the deposit transaction cannot be used to lookup the status of the bridge.
To help with debugging transaction, make sure to store the `requestId` along with other data (quotes, transactions, 
bridges, etc). The `requestId` is unique to Relay's database and will be returned with the quote.


## Example Request
You will find an example below of sending 0.01 ETH from Base to Optimism.

```curl
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.relay.link/quote' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"user": "0xF0AE622e463fa757Cf72243569E18Be7Df1996cd",
	"originChainId": 8453,
	"originCurrency": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
	"destinationChainId": 10,
	"destinationCurrency": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
	"tradeType": "EXACT_INPUT",
	"recipient": "0xF0AE622e463fa757Cf72243569E18Be7Df1996cd",
	"amount": "100000000000000000",
	"usePermit": false,
	"useExternalLiquidity": false,
	"referrer": "relay.link/bridge",
	"useDepositAddress": true,
	"refundTo": "0xF0AE622e463fa757Cf72243569E18Be7Df1996cd"
}'
```
- `useDepositAddress` must be set to `true` <br />
- `refundTo` must be set when `useDepositAddress` is being used. 
This is the address that refunds will be sent to in case of an issue.

- There will only ever be one step in the response.
- The deposit transaction will never have any calldata.
