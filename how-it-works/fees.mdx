### Fee Glossary

Relay quotes include the following fees: `gas`, `relayerService`, and `relayerGas`. The two relayer fees (service and gas) are combined to make the full `relayer` fee.

**gas**: The gas fee to be paid on the origin chain to execute the transaction. This is usually paid by the user to deposit funds to the relayer to initiate the bridge or swap.

**relayer**: The sum of the relayerService and the relayerGas.

**relayerService**: The service fee paid to the relayer to facilitate execution.

**relayerGas**: The gas fee given to the solver to pay gas fees on the destination chain.

**app**: Third party fees added on top of the existing fees, this fee is added by app developers and accrues offchain to minimize gas costs.

Gas fees are estimates and may fluctuate over time, if using in a calculation we recommend adding a small buffer to account for these fluctuations.

### What are app fees?

App Fee(s) are specified while generating a quote. They accrue off-chain, meaning they are not paid out immediately and instead require the app fee payee to manually claim the fee later. 
The fee is specified in bps (basis points) over the input value of the order. When specifying a fee, a claim address is also provided which can be used to withdraw fees. Multiple app fees can be specified for a single quote.
The accrual happening offchain means that we have a database table of the app fee payee address, the currency, and the amount of funds they have claim over for that currency.
You can accrue fees by including `appFees` in the [Quote API](https://docs.relay.link/references/api/get-quote).
The app fee payee can claim their accrued fees on any chain that the payment currency exists on. So if they accrued USDC on 50 different chains, we consolidate this automatically when they proceed with claiming their balance.
The app fee claim works by requesting a quote from originChainId=0, and following the steps to prove your ownership over the claim address by signing a signature and submitting it to us.

App fees work differently for cross-chain and same-chain requests:

**Cross-Chain:**
- App Fee is accrued in the currency sent to the solver
- App Fee is accrued after the fill transaction completes

**Same-Chain:**
- App fees can be applied to same-chain swaps only, not for wraps/unwraps/sends.
- The app fee amount is added to the operation in the form of native currency. Even if the user is not spending native currency in the operation, so its possible for the user to swap from $MOG -> $MEME, and pay some extra ETH to the solver to pay the app fee.
- NOTE: This app fee is required to be sent, if not, the tx will fail
- If the original input currency is native currency, instead of adding more native currency required to be sent, we subtract it from the amount being sent.
- The app fee is accrued after the same-chain transaction is indexed

App fee balance can be checked via the config api, the steps to which are outlined below:

#### How do I know my offchain balance?

Look up accrued offchain fees by using the [config](/references/api/get-config) api. Make sure that you pass in the originChainId as 0. Here's an example of how the url should be constructed:

[`https://api.relay.link/config/v2?originChainId=0&currencyId=eth&user=0x03508bB71268BBA25ECaCC8F620e01866650532c&destinationChainId=1`](https://api.relay.link/config/v2?originChainId=0\&currencyId=eth\&user=0x03508bB71268BBA25ECaCC8F620e01866650532c\&destinationChainId=1)

The user balance property will reflect the offchain balance:

```
{
  "enabled": true,
  "user": {
    "balance": "111912125413088295",
    "maxBridgeAmount": "110982574378439751"
  },
  "solver": {
    "address": "0xf70da97812cb96acdf810712aa562db8dfa3dbef",
    "balance": "164745206761785203599",
    "capacityPerRequest": "131796165409428162879"
  },
  "supportsExternalLiquidity": false
}
```

#### How can I claim my offchain balance?

To claim the funds, all you need to do is create a bridge to any chain from chainId 0, this will transfer the offchain balance to your wallet on the desired chain. Below are some examples of how to do this:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash API
  curl --request POST \
    --url https://api.relay.link/execute/bridge \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{
    "user": "0x03508bB71268BBA25ECaCC8F620e01866650532c",
    "originChainId": 0,
    "destinationChainId": 1,
    "currency": "eth",
    "amount": "1000"
  }'
  ```

  ```javascript SDK
  import { getClient } from '@reservoir0x/relay-sdk'
  import { useWalletClient } from 'wagmi'

  const { data: wallet } = useWalletClient()

  const quote = await getClient()?.actions.getQuote({
    wallet,
    chainId: 0,
    toChainId: 1,
    amount: '1000',
    currency: 'eth'
  })

  await relayClient.actions.execute({
    quote,
    wallet,
    onProgress(steps) {
      setStep(getCurrentStepDescription(steps))
    },
  })

  ```
