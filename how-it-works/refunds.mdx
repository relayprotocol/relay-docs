Relay strives for 100% successful bridges & swaps. Occassionally, due to a variety of 
possible circumstances, a bridge or swap might be refunded instead of completed. 
Learn more about Relay's refund logic and how it works. 

## What is a refund?
A refund is returned funds to a user due to a failed swap or bridge.
Relay will refund the user's their funds on the destination chain. 
However, if the refund amount is not enough to cover the cost of gas, the relay will be marked
as failed & no refund will be sent.

## What is refunded?
For bridges, Relay will refund the user in the original currency they sent.
For swaps, Relay will refunds users in the default currency of the chain.  You can determine 
the default currency of a chain by looking at the fee currency. For example,
if a chain's default currency is ETH than ETH will be refunded. We have a few chains that
their native currency is not ETH: Avalanche uses USDC, Polygon uses USDC, Xai uses Xai, and
Degen uses Degen.

## When does a refund happen?
A refund happens automatically when a swap or bridge fails to complete.
If a failure occurs, Relay will refund the user's funds in an 1 hour or less. Please 
remember no refund is given if the refund amount cannot cover the cost of gas.

## Why do refunds happen?
A refund is triggered when the swap or bridge fails to complete.
A failure can occur for a variety of reasons including but not exclusive to:
- *Transactions Reverting:* Before giving a quote, we simulate the transaction to insure it will succeed.
Between the time the quote is given and the user accepts & deposits funds, the transaction could revert.
Transactions reverting could be cause by if there is a contested mint or execution was delayed.
- *User's Wallet Address is Different Than Transaction Depositing Address:* This happens when the user
switches wallets right before signing the transaction. Users must execute the transaction with the wallet
address that received the quote.
- *User Deposits Too Little:* There are two cases for how this can happen.
  1. The user explicitly deposits a lower amount than Relay requested.
  2. The user sent the deposit we requested but did so delayed so the original quote is no longer valid.
  Quotes expire after 1 minute then a new quote is generated. 
- *Destination Chain is Unavailable:* Occasionally, the destination chain will
have a network outage beyond our control. An example could be an RPC that is down or 
the chain is experiencing a large reorginization.
- *User Sends Deposits With the Same Request ID in the Calldata multiple times*
- *User Send Deposits Without a Request ID in the Calldata*
