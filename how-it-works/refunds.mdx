Relay strives for 100% successful bridges & swaps. Occassionally, due to a variety of 
possible circumstances, a bridge or swap might be refunded instead of completed. 
You can learn how Relay handles those refunds in this guide.

## What causes a refund?
A refund is triggered when the swap or bridge fails to complete.
A failure can occur for a variety of reasons including but not exclusive to:
- *Transactions Reverting:* Before giving a quote, we simulate the transaction to insure it will succeed.
Between the time the quote is given and the user accepts & deposits funds, the transaction could revert.
Transactions revertin: could be cause by if there is a contested mint or execution was delayed.
- *User's Wallet Address is Different Than Transaction Depositing Address:* This happens when the user
switches wallets right before signing the transaction. Users must execute the transaction with the wallet
address that received the quote.
- *User Deposits Too Little:* There are two cases for how this can happen.
  1. The user explicityly deposits a lower amount than Relay requested.
  2. The user sent the deposit we requested but did so delayed so the original quote is no longer valid.
  Quotes expire after 1 minute then a new quote is generated. 
- *User Sends Deposits With the Same Request ID in the Calldata multiple times*
- *User Send Deposits Without a Request ID in the Calldata*
