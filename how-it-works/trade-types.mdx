Relay supports two trade types: `exact_input` & `exact_output`.

Learn about how these work and what secnarios they best support.

## Exact Input

The first supported type is `EXACT_INPUT`. In this order type, the user specifies how much of the input currency they want to provide for a swap or brigde. 
The user is told how much of the output token they will receive for a given input.
This trade type fails if the input amount is too small to cover associated fees with the request. Associated fees can include but are not limited to 
relay fees, app fees, and gas fees.

## Exact Output

The second supported type is `EXACT_OUTPUT`. In this order type, the user specifies how much of the output currency they want to receive from the swap or bridge. 
The user is told how much of the origin token this will require.
This trade type automatically accounts for any associated fees including relay fees, app fees, and gas fees.
We recommend using `EXACT_OUTPUT` for very small amounts to be bridged/swapped.
