Relay Depository represents a set of smart contracts across different chains and VM types providing an entry point to the Relay Hub.
They allow users to deposit tokens into the Relay Protocol from any chain that is supported by the protocol, tokens which can then be used for executing various actions on the Relay Hub.

Relay Depository contracts are open-sourced and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/relayprotocol/relay-protocol-contracts). Feel free to contribute to the project.
