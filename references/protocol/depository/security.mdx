## Threat model

The Depository contract is receiving from users and an `allocator` can sign messages authorizing the withdrawal of funds from the depository. As such the `allocator` itself has to be trusted to only sign messages if the user's intent was successfully filled.

The contract is **not** upgradable, meaning that once deployed, the code cannot be changed.

## Audits

The Relay Depository contracts written in Solidity have been audited by [Spearbit](https://spearbit.com/). At the time the contract was called `CreditMaster` and you can find the [audit reports in our Github repo](https://github.com/relayprotocol/relay-vaults/blob/main/docs/README.md) (Note that the audit includes other contracts as well, such as the [vaults contracts](../vaults/)).

The Relay Depository contracts written in Solana have been audited by [Certora](https://www.certora.com/) and you can find the [audit reports](https://github.com/relayprotocol/relay-depository/blob/main/audit-reports/Certora-Relay-Escrow-Report.pdf).
