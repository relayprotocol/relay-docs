The Relay Hub is the core component of the Relay protocol.
It is responsible for tracking ownership of funds, doing so based on a combination of external actions attested by an oracle, and internal actions executed by users directly via the Hub interface.

A reference implementation of a Relay Hub is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/relayprotocol/relay-protocol-hub). Feel free to contribute to the project.
