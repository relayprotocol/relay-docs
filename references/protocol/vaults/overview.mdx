Relay Vaults are [ERC4626](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-4626/) compliant vaults that allow users to deposit and withdraw tokens while earning yield. They are designed to be composable, meaning they can be integrated with other DeFi protocols and applications.

They get their yield from both a "base" yield generated by lending protocols such as Aave and Morpho, and a "boost" yield generated by rebalancing transactions between L2 blockchains and the chain on which the vault is deployed.

The Relay team has deployed several vaults on networks such as Ethereum, Base or Arbitrum and acts as a curator for these vaults. You can [use our UI](http://relay.link/vaults/) to deposit and withdraw from these vaults, or you can interact with them directly through the smart contracts. The Relay team also uses these vaults to rebalance funds between L2 blockchains and the chain on which the vault is deployed.

Finally, the Relay team has created a backend service used to index and query vault data, making it easier for developers to build on top of the Relay Vaults infrastructure. It is accessible at [https://vaults-api.relay.link/](https://vaults-api.relay.link/).

Relay vaults are open-sourced and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/relayprotocol/relay-vaults). Feel free to contribute to the project.
