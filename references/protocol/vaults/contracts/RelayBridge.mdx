## RelayBridge

RelayBridge contract enabling cross-chain bridging via Hyperlane

  address poolAsset;
  uint256 poolGas;
  bytes extraData;
  uint256 nonce;

| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| nonce | uint256 | The nonce of the failed transaction |

### InsufficientValue

```solidity
error InsufficientValue(uint256 received, uint256 expected)

| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| value | uint256 | The amount of native currency that failed to refund |

### transferNonce

```solidity
uint256 transferNonce
```

Counter for assigning unique nonces to bridge transactions

_Incremented with each bridge transaction to ensure uniqueness_

### ASSET

```solidity
address ASSET
```

Asset address on the origin chain being bridged (address(0) for native currency)

_Immutable to ensure the bridge always handles the same asset_

### BRIDGE_PROXY

```solidity
contract BridgeProxy BRIDGE_PROXY
```

BridgeProxy contract handling origin-chain transfer logic

_Uses delegatecall to execute custom bridge logic_

### HYPERLANE_MAILBOX

```solidity
address HYPERLANE_MAILBOX
```

Hyperlane Mailbox contract for cross-chain messaging

_Used to dispatch messages to the pool chain_

### BridgeInitiated

```solidity
event BridgeInitiated(uint256 nonce, address sender, address recipient, address ASSET, address poolAsset, uint256 amount, contract BridgeProxy BRIDGE_PROXY)
```

Emitted when a bridge transaction is initiated on the origin chain

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| nonce | uint256 | Nonce of the transaction |
| sender | address | Address on the origin chain that initiated the bridge |
| recipient | address | Address on the pool chain to receive assets |
| ASSET | address | Asset address on the origin chain (address(0) for native currency) |
| poolAsset | address | Asset address on the pool chain (address(0) for native currency) |
| amount | uint256 | Amount of asset units bridged |
| BRIDGE_PROXY | contract BridgeProxy | BridgeProxy used |

### BridgeExecuted

```solidity
event BridgeExecuted(uint256 nonce)
```

Emitted after a bridge transaction is executed on the pool chain

_This event would be emitted by the pool chain contract_

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| nonce | uint256 | Nonce of the executed transaction |

### BridgeCancelled

```solidity
event BridgeCancelled(uint256 nonce)
```

Emitted if a bridge transaction is cancelled prior to execution

_This event would be emitted if a bridge is cancelled_

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| nonce | uint256 | Nonce of the cancelled transaction |

### constructor

```solidity
constructor(address asset, contract BridgeProxy bridgeProxy, address hyperlaneMailbox) public
```

Initializes the RelayBridge with asset and infrastructure contracts

_All parameters are immutable after deployment_

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| asset | address | Asset address on the origin chain to bridge (0 for native currency) |
| bridgeProxy | contract BridgeProxy | BridgeProxy contract for origin-chain transfers |
| hyperlaneMailbox | address | Hyperlane Mailbox address for messaging |

### getFee

```solidity
function getFee(uint256 amount, address recipient, uint256 poolGas) external view returns (uint256 fee)
```

Calculates the fee required in native currency to dispatch a cross-chain message

_Uses Hyperlane's quoteDispatch to estimate the cross-chain messaging fee_

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| amount | uint256 | Amount of asset units to bridge |
| recipient | address | Address on the pool chain that will receive the bridged asset |
| poolGas | uint256 | Gas limit for the pool chain transaction |

#### Return Values

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| fee | uint256 | Required fee in native currency for dispatch |

### bridge

```solidity
function bridge(uint256 amount, address recipient, address poolAsset, uint256 poolGas, bytes extraData) external payable returns (uint256 nonce)
```

Bridges an asset (ERC20 token or native currency) from the origin chain to a pool chain

_Executes a cross-chain bridge transaction with the following steps:
     1. Validates sufficient payment for fees (and asset amount if native)
     2. Transfers the asset from sender to this contract (if ERC20)
     3. Executes bridge logic via delegatecall to BRIDGE_PROXY
     4. Dispatches cross-chain message via Hyperlane
     5. Refunds any excess native currency to sender_

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| amount | uint256 | Amount of asset units to bridge (ERC20 tokens or native currency) |
| recipient | address | Address on the pool chain to receive the bridged asset |
| poolAsset | address | Address of the asset on the pool chain to bridge to |
| poolGas | uint256 | Gas limit for the pool chain transaction |
| extraData | bytes | Extra data passed to the bridge proxy |

#### Return Values

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| nonce | uint256 | Unique identifier for this bridge transaction |
