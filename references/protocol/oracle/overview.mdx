Relay Oracle is the communication channel between external chains and the Relay Hub.
Given that the Relay Hub has no access to outside information, it relies on the Oracle for attesting specific pieces of information.

Today, the Relay core team is running an internal version of the Relay Oracle.

A reference implementation of a Relay Oracle is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/relayprotocol/relay-protocol-oracle). Feel free to contribute to the project.
