sidebarTitle: Overview
---

The Relay Protocol is a set of smart contracts and systems that enable secure, efficient, and permissionless cross-chain transactions and payments. It ensures that all components of the system can communicate effectively and securely, enabling a seamless user experience.

The protocol is made of various components which can work independently or together. These components include:

- [Relay Depository](./depository/)
- [Relay Oracle](./oracle/)
- [Relay Hub](./hub/)
- [Relay Vaults](./vaults/)

You can interact with the Relay Protocol through our [Relay](https://relay.link) app, which provides a reference UI. You can also find the source code for all the components of the Relay Protocol on [GitHub](https://github.com/relayprotocol/).

> **Note:** The Relay Protocol is a "work in progress" and its design and implementation may change over time. We welcome contributions and feedback from the community to help improve the protocol.

### Basic Flow

Alice sends her funds to the Depository contract on the origin chain. The [Relayer](/how-it-works/the-reservoir-relayer) fills Alice's request on the destination chain. The [Hub](./hub/) keeps track of that deposit. The Relayer can then trigger the [Oracle](./oracle/) to verify that the intent was correctly filled. If so, the Relayer can then settle the payment and access their user's deposited funds.

In order to fill on multiple chains, the Relayer needs to keep balances on every supported network. The [Vaults](./vaults/) are used to rebalance the Relayer's balances across chains.
