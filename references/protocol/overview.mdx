The Relay Protocol is a set of smart contracts and systems that enable secure, efficient, and permissionless cross-chain transactions and payments. It ensures that all components of the system can communicate effectively and securely, enabling a seamless user experience.

The protocol is made of various components which can work independently or together. These components include:

- [Relay Vaults](./vaults/)
- Relay Depository
- Relay Hub

You can interact with the Relay Protocol through our [Relay](https://relay.link), which provides a reference UI. You can also find the source code for all the components of the Relay Protocol on [GitHub](https://github.com/relayprotocol/).
