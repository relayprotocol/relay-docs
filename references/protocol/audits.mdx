We implement and deploy the Relay Protocol incrementally, starting with a minimal set of features and building up to a fully trustless cross-chain payments system. Each component is audited by leading security firms to ensure the safety of user funds.

Here is the list of audits we have completed so far:

| Date          | Scope                                                                                                      | Auditor                                                     | Report                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
