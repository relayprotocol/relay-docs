In this guide, we will cover how to interact with Relay Vaults, whether you are a user, a liquidity provider (LP), a developer, or a curator.

## As a Liquidity Provider (LP)

As an LP, you're most likely going to interact with Relay Vaults through the [Relay UI](https://relay.link/vaults). You can deposit and withdraw funds from the vaults, and you can also track your yields and balances.

You can also interact directly with the smart contracts or using block explorers like Etherscan and Blockscout.

## As a developer

As a developer, you should consider interacting with the vaults using the smart-contracts. We publish npm packages such as `@relay-vaults/abis` that includes all the ABI definitions for the vaults. We also publish `@relay-vaults/client` that includes a graphQL client to interract with the [backend API](../backend.mdx).

Finally, you can also use our hardhat tasks to perform deposits and withdrawals from the vaults. These tasks are available in the [Relay Vaults GitHub repository](https://github.com/relayprotocol/relay-vaults/tree/main/smart-contracts).
