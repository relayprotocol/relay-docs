# Solidity API

## RelayPoolTimelock

Interface for initializing timelock contracts

_Used to initialize cloned timelock instances with proper access control_

### initialize

```solidity
function initialize(uint256 minDelay, address[] proposers, address[] executors, address admin) external
```

Initializes a timelock contract with the specified parameters

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| minDelay | uint256 | The minimum delay in seconds for timelock operations |
| proposers | address[] | Array of addresses that can propose operations |
| executors | address[] | Array of addresses that can execute operations |
| admin | address | The admin address (use address(0) for no admin) |

## RelayPoolFactory

Factory contract for deploying RelayPool instances with associated timelocks

_Deploys pools with timelock governance and tracks pools by asset_

### HYPERLANE_MAILBOX

```solidity
address HYPERLANE_MAILBOX
```

The Hyperlane mailbox address used by all deployed pools

_Immutable to ensure consistency across all pools_

### WETH

```solidity
address WETH
```

The WETH contract address for native currency pools

_Used when creating pools that handle native currency_

### TIMELOCK_TEMPLATE

```solidity
address TIMELOCK_TEMPLATE
```

The timelock template contract to be cloned

_Each pool gets its own timelock instance cloned from this template_

### MIN_TIMELOCK_DELAY

```solidity
uint256 MIN_TIMELOCK_DELAY
```

The minimum timelock delay enforced for non-owner deployments

_Owner can deploy with shorter delays for testing/special cases_

### poolsByAsset

```solidity
mapping(address => address[]) poolsByAsset
```

Mapping from asset address to array of deployed pool addresses

_Multiple pools can exist for the same asset_

### UnauthorizedCaller

```solidity
error UnauthorizedCaller(address sender)
```

Error when unauthorized address attempts restricted operation

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| sender | address | The address that attempted the unauthorized action |

### InsufficientInitialDeposit

```solidity
error InsufficientInitialDeposit(uint256 deposit)
```

Error when initial deposit is insufficient

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| deposit | uint256 | The insufficient deposit amount provided |

### InsufficientTimelockDelay

```solidity
error InsufficientTimelockDelay(uint256 delay)
```

Error when timelock delay is below minimum requirement

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| delay | uint256 | The insufficient delay provided |

### PoolDeployed

```solidity
event PoolDeployed(address pool, address creator, address asset, string name, string symbol, address thirdPartyPool, address timelock)
```

Emitted when a new pool is deployed

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| pool | address | The address of the deployed RelayPool |
| creator | address | The address that deployed the pool |
| asset | address | The underlying asset of the pool |
| name | string | The name of the pool's share token |
| symbol | string | The symbol of the pool's share token |
| thirdPartyPool | address | The yield pool where assets will be deposited |
| timelock | address | The timelock contract governing the pool |

### constructor

```solidity
constructor(address hMailbox, address weth, address timelock, uint256 minTimelockDelay) public
```

Initializes the factory with required infrastructure addresses

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| hMailbox | address | The Hyperlane mailbox contract address |
| weth | address | The WETH contract address |
| timelock | address | The timelock template to be cloned for each pool |
| minTimelockDelay | uint256 | The minimum delay for timelock operations |

### deployPool

```solidity
function deployPool(contract ERC20 asset, string name, string symbol, address thirdPartyPool, uint256 timelockDelay, uint256 initialDeposit, address curator) public returns (address)
```

Deploys a new RelayPool with associated timelock governance

_Requires initial deposit to prevent inflation attacks, creates dedicated timelock_

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| asset | contract ERC20 | The ERC20 asset for the pool |
| name | string | The name for the pool's share token |
| symbol | string | The symbol for the pool's share token |
| thirdPartyPool | address | The yield pool where idle assets will be deposited |
| timelockDelay | uint256 | The delay in seconds for timelock operations |
| initialDeposit | uint256 | The initial deposit amount (must be at least 1 unit of asset) |
| curator | address | The address that will control the pool through the timelock |

#### Return Values

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| [0] | address | The address of the newly deployed RelayPool |
