### Example

```typescript Custom Zora Mint
import { ConnectButton } from "@rainbow-me/rainbowkit";
import { useCallback } from "react";
import { getClient } from "@reservoir0x/relay-sdk";
import { createPublicClient, http, WriteContractParameters } from "viem";
import { useWalletClient } from "wagmi";
import { createMintClient } from "@zoralabs/protocol-sdk";
import { base, zora } from "viem/chains";

export default function App() {
  const { data: wallet } = useWalletClient({
    chainId: base.id,
  });

  const customMint = useCallback(async () => {
    if (!wallet || !wallet.account?.address) {
      throw "A wallet is required to mint!";
    }

    if (!sdkClient) {
      throw "Relay SDK not initialized";
    }

    const mintClient = createMintClient({ chain: zora });
    const publicClient = createPublicClient({
      chain: zora,
      transport: http(),
    });
    const prepared = await mintClient.makePrepareMintTokenParams({
      // token to mint
      tokenAddress: "0x03e4f2838b2e821d2117a78a278c4e3166d97339",
      tokenId: "4",
      mintArguments: {
        // address that will receive the token
        mintToAddress: wallet.account.address,
        // quantity of tokens to mint
        quantityToMint: 1,
        // comment to include with the mint
        mintComment: "Cross-Chain Minting via Reservoir Relay!",
      },
      // account that is to invoke the mint transaction
      minterAccount: wallet.account.address,
    });

    // simulate the transaction and get any validation errors
    const { request } = await publicClient.simulateContract(prepared);

    sdkClient.actions.call({
      chainId: base.id,
      toChainId: zora.id,
      txs: [request],
      wallet,
      onProgress: ({steps, fees, breakdown, currentStep, currentStepItem, txHashes}) => {
        //custom handling
      },
    });
  }, [wallet]);

  return (
    ...
      <button
        className="button"
        onClick={customMint}
      >
        Custom Mint + Zora SDK
      </button>
    ...
  );
}

//This snippet demonstrates cross chain actions in the form of a mint on Zora from Base.
//The code snippet above assumes you've created the client, properly configured the
//chains and ensured that the user is currently connected to the correct chain.
```
### Handling onProgress updates

The state of progress is updated as users are moved through the flow. The onProgress callback will fire every time there are changes to the status. Below is a breakdown of the data returned and how it may be useful in representing the status:

* __steps__: This is the full steps object as it's returned by the api and enhanced with some additional properties on the client. Notably the step status has been updated as well as any errors have been attached.
* __fees__: This is the full fees object as it's returned by the api
* __breakdown__: This is the full breakdown object as it's returned by the api
* __currentStep__: We've conveniently pinpointed the current step that's being processed and made it accessible in this callback.
* __currentStepItem__: Similarly to the step we've hoisted the current step item that is being processed so it's more easily accessible. A step can contain multiple items that are processed in parallel as a batch.
* __txHashes__: A full list of all the transaction hashes that have been processed so far during execution.
