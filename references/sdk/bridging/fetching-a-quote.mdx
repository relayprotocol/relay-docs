### Before fetching a quote

In your app, you'll need to provide the UI for users to select the Origin chain and Destination chain, as well as the value to bridge.
Before you fetch a quote, you'll also want to check that the Relay solver is enabled and has enough capacity for your request. 
You can get the solver's capacity with the sdk's [`getSolverCapacity`](/references/sdk/actions/getSolverCapacity) method. Optionally, you can call the [Get Config](/references/api/get-config) api directly.

```typescript
import { getClient } from '@reservoir0x/relay-sdk'
import { zeroAddress } from 'viem'

const { solver, enabled } = await getClient()?.actions.getSolverCapacity({
  originChainId: 1, // The chain id to bridge from
  destinationChainId: 7777777, // The chain id to bridge to
  currency: zeroAddress
})
```

You should check that enabled is `true` and that `solver.capacityPerRequest` is greater than the amount you want to bridge. You can also set the max input amount in your UI equal to the `solver.capacityPerRequest`.


### Fetching a Quote
Once you have all of the required values, you can pass them into the  [`getQuote`](/references/sdk/actions/getQuote) method like so:

```typescript
import { getClient } from '@reservoir0x/relay-sdk'
import { useWalletClient } from 'wagmi'

const { data: wallet } = useWalletClient()

const quote = await getClient()?.actions.getQuote({
  wallet,
  chainId: 1, // The chain id to bridge from
  toChainId: 7777777, // The chain id to bridge to
  amount: '100000000000000000', // Amount in wei to bridge
  currency: '0x0000000000000000000000000000', // ERC20 Address
  toCurrency: '0x0000000000000000000000000000', // ERC20 Address
  recipient, // A valid address to send the funds to
})
```

In the above example, we fetch the quote to bridge 0.1 ETH from Ethereum Mainnet to Zora. In the quote object we'll get data on the fees required to do this bridge. You can learn more about fees [here](/how-it-works/fees).

**Note** - Quotes can go stale after 30 seconds. Clients should regularly fetch fresh quotes so that users are always submitting valid transactions. See [Getting a quote](/how-it-works/the-reservoir-relayer#getting-a-quote) for more information on how quotes work.
