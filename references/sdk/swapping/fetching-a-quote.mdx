<Note>The `getCallQuote` sdk method works very similarly and allows you to get the quote to perform any tx cross-chain, you'll just need to provide the call data</Note>

### Fetching a Quote
Once you have all of the required values, you can pass them into the  [`getSwapQuote`](/references/sdk/methods/getSwapQuote) method like so:

```typescript
import { getClient } from '@reservoir0x/relay-sdk'
import { useWalletClient } from 'wagmi'

const { data: wallet } = useWalletClient()

const quote = await getClient()?.actions.getSwapQuote({
  wallet,
  chainId: 1, // The chain id to swap from
  currency: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  toChainId: 8543, // The chain id to swap to
  toCurrency: "0x833589fcd6edb6e08f4c7c32d4f71b54bda02913",
  amount: '100000000000000000', // Amount in wei to swap
  recipient, // A valid address to send the funds to
})
```

In the above example, we fetch the quote to swap 0.1 ETH from Ethereum Mainnet to USDC on Base. 

### Fees
In the quote object we'll get data on the fees required to do the swap, `quote.fees` gives us these values: 

| Property | Description                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| gas     | The origin gas fee                    |
| relayer | The total fees paid to the relayer                         |
| relayerGas |  The gas paid on the desination chain by the relayer                     |
| relayerService   | A small fixed fee paid to the relayer |
| app   | A custom fee in the wei currency of the swapped amount. This value accrues offchain |

Each fee is returned in the following object:
```
"currency": {
    "chainId": 1,
    "address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    "symbol": "ETH",
    "name": "Ether",
    "decimals": 18,
    "metadata": {
        "logoURI": "https://assets.relay.link/icons/1/light.png",
        "verified": true,
        "isNative": true
    }
},
"amount": "268728569736000",
"amountFormatted": "0.000268728569736",
"amountUsd": "0.847315"
```

The `quote.fees.gas` is the estimated gas required to send the transaction from the Origin chain. Gas can flucuate, so it is worth adding a bit of a buffer on this value as it is just an estimate. The  `quote.fees.relayer` is the total fee paid to the relayer to handle the transaction on the destination chain. You do not need to add a buffer to the relayer fee because it is a precise quote. However, quotes can go stale after 30 seconds, so we recommend refreshing the quote every 12-15 seconds.

Fees are taken out of the output amount (unless the tradeType is set to "EXACT_OUTPUT", then you'll get the full amount returned in the details object).

### Details

There's also a `details` object containing a full summary of the swap. This is extremely useful when rendering this information in your UI. Below is an example of what this might look like:

```
"details": {
"sender": "0x03508bB71268BBA25ECaCC8F620e01866650532c",
"recipient": "0xf70da97812cb96acdf810712aa562db8dfa3dbef",
"currencyIn": {
    "currency": {
        "chainId": 1,
        "address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
        "symbol": "ETH",
        "name": "Ether",
        "decimals": 18,
        "metadata": {
            "logoURI": "https://assets.relay.link/icons/1/light.png",
            "verified": true,
            "isNative": true
        }
    },
    "amount": "10000000000000000",
    "amountFormatted": "0.01",
    "amountUsd": "31.530500"
},
"currencyOut": {
    "currency": {
        "chainId": 8453,
        "address": "0x833589fcd6edb6e08f4c7c32d4f71b54bda02913",
        "symbol": "USDC",
        "name": "USD Coin",
        "decimals": 6,
        "metadata": {
            "logoURI": "https://ethereum-optimism.github.io/data/USDC/logo.png",
            "verified": false,
            "isNative": false
        }
    },
    "amount": "31318242",
    "amountFormatted": "31.318242",
    "amountUsd": "31.494060"
},
"rate": "3131.8242"
}
```

Note that the rate is the rate of 1 unit of input to x output. In this case 1 ETH is equal to 3131.8242 USDC output. This swap rate may flucatuate given the currency pool size, amount and fees.
