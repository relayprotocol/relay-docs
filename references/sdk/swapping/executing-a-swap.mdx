<Note>The `call` sdk action works very similarly and allows you to perform any tx cross-chain</Note>

### Before executing a swap

Before executing a swap, you should verify that the user has enough balance on the origin chain to cover the gas fee required for swapping.

### Executing a swap

Use the sdk's [`swap`](/references/sdk/actions/swap) action to execute the swap and automatically handle the execution of steps.

```typescript
import { getClient } from '@reservoir0x/relay-sdk'
import { useWalletClient } from 'wagmi'

const { data: wallet } = useWalletClient()

await getClient()?.actions.swap({
  wallet,
  chainId: 1, // The chain id to swap from
  currency: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  toChainId: 8543, // The chain id to swap to
  toCurrency: "0x833589fcd6edb6e08f4c7c32d4f71b54bda02913",
  amount: '100000000000000000', // Amount in wei to swap
  recipient, // A valid address to send the funds to
  onProgress: ({
    steps,
    currentStep,
    currentStepItem,
    txHashes,
    details
  }) => {
    console.log(steps, fees, currentStep, currentStepItem, details)
  }
})
```

All you have to do now is use the `onProgress` callback to 
update your UI with the current step and status. The `currentStep` has an `action` and `description` that can be helpful to display in your UI. Each `stepItem` also has an array of `txHashes` that you can use to link users to their transactions on a blockexplorer. In addition to that there's also a `details` object which summarizes the swap, currencyIn and currencyOut etc.

Once all `stepsItems` have a `status` of `complete`, the swap was completed successfully and you you can show a success screen in your UI. ✅
