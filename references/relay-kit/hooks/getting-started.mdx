## Installation 
Use this lightweight React hook package to integrate Relay into your custom interface. Start by installing the required packages:

<CodeGroup>
```shell yarn
yarn add react react-dom viem @tanstack/react-query @reservoir0x/relay-kit-hooks
```
```shell npm
npm install --save react react-dom viem @tanstack/react-query @reservoir0x/relay-kit-hooks
```
```shell pnpm
pnpm add react react-dom viem @tanstack/react-query @reservoir0x/relay-kit-hooks
```
```shell bun
bun add react react-dom viem @tanstack/react-query @reservoir0x/relay-kit-hooks
```
</CodeGroup>

If using typescript ensure that you're on v5+. Refer to the package json for the latest version requirements for the peer dependencies. 

## Tanstack Query Setup
The hooks require [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) to be installed and configured. Refer to the [Tanstack installation instructions](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/installation). Once Tanstack is configured in your React application, that's all you need to get started.

## Hooks
Each hook is configured separately to allow for as much flexibility as possible. All hooks come with a query function that can be used outside of a React context to fetch the data (useful when using SSR or in a context that doesn't use React).
