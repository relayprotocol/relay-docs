Relay is a multichain payments network. You define the Intent (what the user wants), and Relay handles the Execution (how to get there).

Follow this 5-step flow to integrate Relay into your application:

![Core Loop](/images/core-loop.png)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure">
    To see how fast and simple Relay makes transacting cross-chain, let’s bridge real assets between inexpensive L2s—Base and Arbitrum.

    **Prerequisites:**

    - **Base URL:** `https://api.relay.link`
    - **Environment:** Node.js installed
    - **Wallet:** An EOA with a small amount of ETH (~$2.00 USD equivalent) on Base

    ### Coming Soon: API Key Provisioning
    A self-serve form to request API keys is currently in development. For now, you can start building immediately without one.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Quote">
    Every action in Relay starts with a Quote. 

    The [quote endpoint](/references/api/get-quote-v2) handles all of your use cases, whether it’s a [**bridge**](/use-cases/bridging), [**swap**](/use-cases/cross-chain-swaps), or [**cross-chain call**](/use-cases/calling). It calculates fees, finds the best route, and generates the transaction data.

    ## **Request**

    As an example, let’s consider the scenario of bridging 0.0001 ETH from Base (Chain ID 8453) to Arbitrum One (Chain ID 42161): <br/>
    _Note: the `requestId` will be unique to every request._

  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute">
    The [quote endpoint](/references/api/get-quote-v2) returns a steps array. Think of this as a recipe your application must follow. You need to iterate through these steps and prompt the user to sign or submit them.
    <Callout icon="person-swimming" color="#4615C8">
      ### Deep Dive
      For the full logic on parsing steps, see [Understanding Step Execution](/references/api/api_core_concepts/step-execution).    
    </Callout>

    ## The Logic
    For a simple ETH bridge, the `steps` array contains a single transaction item. To execute it:

    - **Check the Step Kind:** Identify if the step is a `transaction` (submit to chain) or a `signature` (sign off-chain).
    - **Execute:** For transactions, submit the provided `data`, `to`, `value`, and `chainId` using the user's wallet. For signatures, follow the `signatureKind` provided in the step item to sign the `message`.

    <Callout icon="plus" color="#4615C8">
    ### Need More Complexity?
    For the full logic on parsing steps, see [Understanding Step Execution](/references/api/api_core_concepts/step-execution). Because Relay's API is generic, this exact same loop automatically handles advanced flows:

    - [**Cross-Chain Swaps**](/references/api/api_guides/bridging-integration-guide): Uses the same logic as bridging; just change the input/output currencies in the Quote.
    - [**Smart Accounts**](/references/api/api_guides/smart_accounts/smart-accounts): Batches multiple steps into a single atomic user operation.
    - [**Contract Calls**](/references/api/api_guides/calling-integration-guide): Executes arbitrary logic (like NFT mints) on the destination chain.
    </Callout>

    ## The Script (Node.js / Viem example)
    Copy the script below to execute the transaction returned by the Quote in Step 2. You'll need to add the wallet connection logic using your preferred provider.
    ```typescript
    // npm install viem
    import { createWalletClient, http } from 'viem';
    import { privateKeyToAccount } from 'viem/accounts';
    import { base } from 'viem/chains';

    // 1. Setup Wallet (Base)
    //Initialize your wallet using a provider or your preferred method
    const account = {}
    const client = createWalletClient({
      account,
      chain: base,
      transport: http()
    });

    // 2. The Quote from Step 2 (Paste JSON response)
    const quote = { /* PASTE_FULL_JSON_RESPONSE_HERE */ };

    async function execute() {
      console.log("🚀 Starting Execution...");

      // Iterate through steps (usually just 1 for ETH bridge)
      for (const step of quote.steps) {
        //Although there is an array of items, you can safely select the first item
        //as there is just one returned
        const item = step.items[0]
        if (step.kind === 'transaction') {
          console.log(`Submitting Transaction...`);
          
          // 3. Send Transaction
          const hash = await client.sendTransaction({
            to: item.data.to,
            data: item.data.data, 
            value: BigInt(item.data.value),
            chain: base 
          });
          
          //4. Optional but you may want to wait for the transaction receipt
          //to ensure that the origin transaction was successfully submitted.
          
          console.log(`✅ Bridge Initiated: ${hash}`);
          console.log(`requestId: ${step.requestId}`); // Save this for Step 4!
        }
      }
    }

    execute();
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor">
    Once you submit the transaction, the Relay Solver detects the deposit and fills the request on the destination chain. Use the [status endpoint](/references/api/get-intents-status-v3) with the  requestId located inside each step object in your [quote response](/references/api/quickstart#request) to track status and confirm success. You can also use the `check.endpoint` property inside the step item object as the endpoint for checking the status of the request. <br/>
    _Note: Replace with the requestId returned in your quote_

      ```bash Request
      curl "https://api.relay.link/intents/status/v3?requestId=0x20538510fd9eab7a90c3e54418f8f477bfef24d83c11955a8ca835e6154b59d3"
      ```

      ### Tip
      Poll this endpoint once per second. For a real-time status stream you can subscribe to Relay’s [websocket server](/references/api/api_guides/websockets).
    </Tip>

    ## Status Lifecycle
    The diagram below illustrates the journey of a cross-chain transaction through Relay's infrastructure and the corresponding API statuses. Below are descriptions for each status. Refer to the [Get Status](/references/api/get-intents-status-v3) endpoint for a full list of statuses and what they mean.

    - `waiting`: The user is submitting or has submitted the deposit transaction to the Relay Depository contract on the origin chain, but it has not yet been indexed by the system.
    - `pending`: The deposit was successfully indexed. The Relay Solver is now monitoring the request and preparing the fill transaction on the destination chain.
    - `success`: The Relay Solver successfully executed the "Fill Tx", and the funds have reached the recipient.
    
    ![Status Lifecycle](/images/status-lifecycle.png)

    The diagram also depicts failure paths where a transaction may end up in a failure or refund state if the fill cannot be completed. Learn more about how Relay helps you handle [refunds](https://docs.relay.link/references/api/api_core_concepts/refunds).
