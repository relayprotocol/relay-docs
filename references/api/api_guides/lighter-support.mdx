<Note>
  Currently, only deposits to Lighter are supported. Withdrawals from Lighter are not yet available.
</Note>

# Prerequisites

Before you can bridge funds to Lighter, you must first set up an account on [lighter.exchange](https://lighter.exchange/). Once your account is created, you can retrieve your account index to use as the recipient for deposits.

# API Access

Lighter can be accessed using the standard Relay API flow. To get started, review the [**execution steps**](https://docs.relay.link/references/api/api_core_concepts/step-execution) documentation. When you're ready to execute deposits, refer to the [**Get Quote**](https://docs.relay.link/references/api/get-quote-v2) API endpoint.

## Lighter-Specific API Parameters

| **Parameter**       | **Input**   | **Description**                                      |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| toChainId           | 3586256     | Lighter Chain ID                                     |
| recipient           |             | Lighter Account Index (not a wallet address)         |

These parameters are specific to Lighter interactions. All other standard API parameters remain required.

<Warning>
  The `recipient` parameter must be your Lighter account index, not your wallet address. See below for how to retrieve your account index.
</Warning>

## Getting Your Lighter Account Index

To deposit to Lighter, you need to use your Lighter account index as the `recipient` parameter. You can retrieve this using the Lighter API's `accountsByL1Address` endpoint:

```bash
curl 'https://mainnet.zklighter.elliot.ai/api/v1/accountsByL1Address?l1_address=YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS'
```

Replace `YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS` with your Ethereum wallet address. The response will include your `accountIndex`, which you should use as the `recipient` in your quote request.

For more details, see the [Lighter API documentation](https://apidocs.lighter.xyz/reference/accountsbyl1address).

## Example Quote Request

```bash
curl 'https://api.relay.link/quote/v2' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "user": "0xf3d63166f0ca56c3c1a3508fce03ff0cf3fb691e",
    "originChainId": 8453,
    "destinationChainId": 3586256,
    "originCurrency": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
    "destinationCurrency": "0",
    "recipient": "509564",
    "tradeType": "EXACT_INPUT",
    "amount": "1000000000000000000"
  }'
```

In this example:
- `originChainId: 8453` - Depositing from Base
- `destinationChainId: 3586256` - Lighter chain ID
- `recipient: "509564"` - Your Lighter account index (replace with your actual account index)

The response will include the execution steps required to complete the deposit. Follow the standard [step execution](https://docs.relay.link/references/api/api_core_concepts/step-execution) flow to complete the transaction.
