In any given Relay there are three potential fees:

1. `Execution Fees` - fees to cover network gas costs on the origin and/or destination if executed by Relay
2. `Exchange Fees` - fees to liquidity providers that faciliate cross-asset and cross-chain token swaps
3. `App Fees` - fees added on top of a Relay by you, the integrator

If you are interested in learning how app fees work, and how you can add them to your quotes please check out our [App Fees Doc](/features/app-fees).

## Fees Object

The Fees object is returned from the quote API and the requests API. These fees are only the Relay related fee, and are segmentated as the following fees:

**relayerService**: The service fee paid to the relayer to facilitate execution.

**relayerGas**: The gas fee given to the solver to pay gas fees on the destination chain.

**relayer**: The sum of the relayerService and the relayerGas.

**app**: Third party fees added on top of the existing fees, this fee is added by app developers and accrues offchain to minimize gas costs.

**subsidized**: The Fees in the order that are subsidized by the integrator.

## Price Impact

If you are interested in understanding or showing your user the fees of the order more broadly, it's best to look at the `expanded price impact` object which reports:

**swap** - the price impact that results from cross-currency and cross-chain token exchange

**execution** - the price impact that results from execution fees

**relay** - the price impact that results from the relay api fee (if applicable)

**app** - the price impact that results from the app fees (if applicable)
