In any given Relay there are four potential fees:

1. **Execution Fees**

   Fees to cover execution costs including network gas on the origin and/or destination chain.
   - Fill gas estimate (and origin gas estimate for gasless transactions)
   - \$0.02 flat fee
2. **Swap Fees**

   Fees to liquidity providers that facilitate cross-asset and cross-chain token swaps.
   - DEX fees
   - DEX swap impact
   - Solver cross-chain rebalancing fees
3. **Relay Fees**

   Fees charged for using the Relay API gateway and related services.
   - 20% of swap fee
4. **App Fees**

   Fees added on top of a Relay by you, the integrator.

If you are interested in learning how app fees work, and how you can add them to your quotes please check out our [App Fees Doc](/features/app-fees).\
\
_Please note that the above fee structure applies to standard cases. In certain cases, such as route-specific campaigns or promotions, different fees may apply._

## Fees Object

The Fees object is returned from the quote API and the requests API. These fees are only the Relay related fee, and are segmentated as the following fees:

**relayerService**: The service fee paid to the relayer to facilitate execution.

**relayerGas**: The gas fee given to the solver to pay gas fees on the destination chain.

**relayer**: The sum of the relayerService and the relayerGas.

**app**: Third party fees added on top of the existing fees, this fee is added by app developers and accrues offchain to minimize gas costs.

**subsidized**: The Fees in the order that are subsidized by the integrator.

## Price Impact

If you are interested in understanding or showing your user the fees of the order more broadly, it's best to look at the `expanded price impact` object which reports:

**execution** - the price impact that results from execution fees.

**swap** - the price impact that results from cross-currency and cross-chain token exchange

**relay** - the price impact that results from the relay api fee (if applicable)

**app** - the price impact that results from the app fees (if applicable)
