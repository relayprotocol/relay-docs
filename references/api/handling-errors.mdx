title: "Handling Quote Errors"
---

When calling the `/quote` endpoint, various errors may be returned depending on request conditions, user input, or internal routing logic. This guide outlines the possible error codes, their meanings, and how to handle them.

## Expected Errors

These are known validation and routing issues that developers should gracefully handle in their integrations:
