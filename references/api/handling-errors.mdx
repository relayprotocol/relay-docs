title: Handling Quote Errors
---

When calling the `/quote` endpoint, various errors may be returned depending on request conditions, user input, or internal routing logic. This guide outlines the possible error codes, their meanings, and how to handle them.

## Expected Errors

These are known validation and routing issues that developers should gracefully handle in their integrations:

| Error Code | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `AMOUNT_TOO_LOW` | The amount provided is below the minimum threshold required for a quote. |
| `CHAIN_DISABLED` | The origin or destination chain is currently disabled or unsupported. |
| `EXTRA_TXS_NOT_SUPPORTED` | Extra transactions are not supported for this trade type. |
| `FORBIDDEN` | User does not have the required role or permission. |
| `INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS` | The user's wallet does not have enough balance to perform the swap. |
| `INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY` | There is not enough liquidity available to complete the swap. |
| `INVALID_ADDRESS` | The provided user address is not valid. |
| `INVALID_EXTRA_TXS` | The total value of extra transactions exceeds the intended output. |
| `INVALID_GAS_LIMIT_FOR_DEPOSIT_SPECIFIED_TXS` | Deposit-specified transactions are only allowed for exact output swaps. |
| `INVALID_INPUT_CURRENCY` | The provided input currency address is invalid or not supported. |
| `INVALID_OUTPUT_CURRENCY` | The provided output currency address is invalid or not supported. |
| `INVALID_SLIPPAGE_TOLERANCE` | Slippage value is not a valid integer string representing basis points. |
| `NO_INTERNAL_SWAP_ROUTES_FOUND` | No valid swap route exists internally for the selected token pair. |
| `NO_QUOTES` | No available quotes for the given parameters. |
| `NO_SWAP_ROUTES_FOUND` | No route was found to fulfill the quote request with the given parameters. |
| `ROUTE_TEMPORARILY_RESTRICTED` | This route is temporarily restricted due to high traffic or throttling. |
| `SANCTIONED_CURRENCY` | The token involved in the transaction is on a sanctions list. |
| `SANCTIONED_WALLET_ADDRESS` | The sender or recipient wallet address is sanctioned or blacklisted. |
| `SWAP_IMPACT_TOO_HIGH` | The swap's price impact exceeds acceptable thresholds. |
| `UNAUTHORIZED` | The user is not authenticated or lacks valid authorization. |
| `UNSUPPORTED_CHAIN` | The specified chain is not supported by the platform. |
| `UNSUPPORTED_CURRENCY` | The specified currency is not supported for input or output. |
| `UNSUPPORTED_EXECUTION_TYPE` | The execution type used is not supported for fee estimation or execution. |
| `UNSUPPORTED_ROUTE` | The swap route combination is not supported. |
| `USER_RECIPIENT_MISMATCH` | User and recipient addresses must match for this type of swap. |

## Unexpected Errors

These indicate infrastructure or downstream failures and are not common:

| Error Code                       | Description                                                               |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DESTINATION_TX_FAILED`          | The relay transaction failed on the destination chain.                    |
| `ERC20_ROUTER_ADDRESS_NOT_FOUND` | The router contract for a token could not be located.                     |
| `UNKNOWN_ERROR`                  | An unclassified or unexpected error occurred.                             |
| `SWAP_QUOTE_FAILED`              | Failed to calculate a quote, possibly due to third-party pricing failure. |
| `PERMIT_FAILED`                  | Permit signature validation failed for token approvals.                   |

## Example Error Responses

**Invalid Input Currency**

```json
{
  "message": "Invalid input or output currency",
  "errorCode": "INVALID_INPUT_CURRENCY"
}
```

### No Routes Found

```json
{
  "message": "No routes found",
  "errorCode": "NO_SWAP_ROUTES_FOUND"
}
```

### Destination Transaction Failed

```json
{
  "message": "Destination transaction failed",
  "errorCode": "DESTINATION_TX_FAILED",
  "errorData": "execution reverted"
}
```

When an endpoint returns an error it will be accompanied with a `code`. The code is a predictable way to anticipate errors and handle them accordingly. Below is a list of errors returned by various APIs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `AMOUNT_TOO_LOW` | Amount is too small to cover transaction fees |
| `ERC20_ROUTER_ADDRESS_NOT_FOUND` | Router address for ERC20 token not found |
| `EXTRA_TXS_NOT_SUPPORTED` | Extra transactions are not supported for this operation |
| `INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS` | Insufficient balance to perform crosschain action |
| `INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY` | Solver liquidity is insufficient to fulfill order |
| `INVALID_ADDRESS` | Address format is invalid or address has been blocked by OFAC |
| `INVALID_EXTRA_TXS` | Provided extra transactions are invalid |
| `NO_QUOTES` | No quotes available for the requested transaction |
| `NO_SWAP_ROUTES_FOUND` | No valid swap routes found for the requested pair |
| `PERMIT_FAILED` | Token permit operation failed |
| `SWAP_IMPACT_TOO_HIGH` | Swap price impact exceeds acceptable threshold |
| `SWAP_QUOTE_FAILED` | Failed to get quote for swap operation |
| `UNAUTHORIZED` | Unauthorized access to authenticated endpoints |
| `UNKNOWN_ERROR` | When the error is unknown |
| `UNSUPPORTED_CHAIN` | Chain id supplied is unsupported |
| `UNSUPPORTED_CURRENCY` | Currency is not a valid native currency or erc20 token |
| `UNSUPPORTED_EXECUTION_TYPE` | Requested execution type is not supported |
| `UNSUPPORTED_ROUTE` | Combination of chains and/or currencies is not supported |
| `USER_RECIPIENT_MISMATCH` | User and recipient addresses do not match when required |

These errors will be accompanied by a contextual message, for example:

```json
{
  "message": "Swap output amount is too small to cover fees required to execute swap",
  "code": "AMOUNT_TOO_LOW"
}
```
