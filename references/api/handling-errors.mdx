title: Handling Errors
---

When an endpoint returns an error it will be accompanied with a `code`. The code is a predictable way to anticipate errors and handle them accordingly. Below is a list of errors returned by various APIs

| Name                    | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| `UNAUTHORIZED`            | Unauthorized access to authenticated endpoints         |
| `UNKNOWN_ERROR`           | When the error is unknown         |
| `UNSUPPORTED_CURRENCY`    | Currency is not a valid native currency or erc20 token         |
| `UNSUPPORTED_CHAIN`       | Chain id supplied is unsupported         |
| `UNSUPPORTED_ROUTE`       | Combination of chains and/or currencies is not supported         |
| `INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS`      | Insufficient balance to perform crosschain action         |
| `INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY`  | Solver liquidity is insufficient to fulfill order         |
| `INVALID_ADDRESS`         | Address format is invalid or address has been blocked by OFAC         |
| `AMOUNT_TOO_LOW`          | Amount is too small to cover transaction fees         |

These errors will be accompanied by a contextual message, for example:

```json
{
  "message": "Swap output amount is too small to cover fees required to execute swap",
  "code": "AMOUNT_TOO_LOW"
}
```
