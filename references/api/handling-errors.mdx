title: Handling Errors
---

When an endpoint returns an error it will be accompanied with a `code`. The code is a predictable way to anticipate errors and handle them accordingly. Below is a list of errors returned by various APIs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `AMOUNT_TOO_LOW` | Amount is too small to cover transaction fees |
| `ERC20_ROUTER_ADDRESS_NOT_FOUND` | Router address for ERC20 token not found |
| `EXTRA_TXS_NOT_SUPPORTED` | Extra transactions are not supported for this operation |
| `INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS` | Insufficient balance to perform crosschain action |
| `INSUFFICIENT_LIQUIDITY` | Solver liquidity is insufficient to fulfill order |
| `INVALID_ADDRESS` | Address format is invalid or address has been blocked by OFAC |
| `INVALID_EXTRA_TXS` | Provided extra transactions are invalid |
| `NO_QUOTES` | No quotes available for the requested transaction |
| `NO_SWAP_ROUTES_FOUND` | No valid swap routes found for the requested pair |
| `PERMIT_FAILED` | Token permit operation failed |
| `SWAP_IMPACT_TOO_HIGH` | Swap price impact exceeds acceptable threshold |
| `SWAP_QUOTE_FAILED` | Failed to get quote for swap operation |
| `UNAUTHORIZED` | Unauthorized access to authenticated endpoints |
| `UNKNOWN_ERROR` | When the error is unknown |
| `UNSUPPORTED_CHAIN` | Chain id supplied is unsupported |
| `UNSUPPORTED_CURRENCY` | Currency is not a valid native currency or erc20 token |
| `UNSUPPORTED_EXECUTION_TYPE` | Requested execution type is not supported |
| `UNSUPPORTED_ROUTE` | Combination of chains and/or currencies is not supported |
| `USER_RECIPIENT_MISMATCH` | User and recipient addresses do not match when required |

These errors will be accompanied by a contextual message, for example:

```json
{
  "message": "Swap output amount is too small to cover fees required to execute swap",
  "code": "AMOUNT_TOO_LOW"
}
```
