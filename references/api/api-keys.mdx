title: "Rate Limits and API Keys"
---

Relay enforces rate limits to ensure platform reliability and fair usage across integrators. Default limits apply to all requests. Higher limits are available via API keys.

## Default Rate Limits (No API Key)

The following limits apply when no API key is provided:

| Endpoint               | Limit                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `/quote`               | 50 requests per minute  |
| `/requests`            | 200 requests per minute |
| `/transactions/status` | 200 requests per minute |
| Other endpoints        | 200 requests per minute |

## API Key Rate Limits

When using an API key, limits increase and are applied per key:

| Endpoint               | Limit                   |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `/quote`               | 10 requests per second  |
| `/requests`            | 10 requests per second  |
| `/transactions/status` | 10 requests per second  |
| Other endpoints        | 200 requests per minute |

API keys are recommended for server-side production integrations and higher-throughput use cases.

## How to Request an API Key

Requirements:

1. Must have Relay integrated in a public app.
2. Must have enough activity to hit default API rate limits.

To request an API key (once requirements are met):

1. Fill out the [API key request form](https://forms.gle/uiRVYXhtH8uBqybR9).
2. The Relay team will review within 72 hours.
3. If approved, we will email your unique API key.

## How to Use an API Key

### HTTP Requests

Pass the API key in the request headers:

```
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

This header should be included on all requests where higher rate limits are required.

### SDK Usage

<CodeGroup>

```jsx Global API Key
// It is recommended to only set the apiKey parameter when using the SDK server-side.
import {
  createClient,
  MAINNET_RELAY_API,
} from "@relayprotocol/relay-sdk";

createClient({
  baseApiUrl: MAINNET_RELAY_API,
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  ...
  //other parameters
});
```


```jsx SDK Action API Key
// In the case that you prefer not to set a global api key 
// you can pass the api key into the headers parameter of the getQuote function. 
import { getClient } from "@relayprotocol/relay-sdk";

const quoteParams = {...}

const quote = await getClient()?.actions.getQuote(params, undefined, {
	"x-api-key": "YOUR_API_KEY"
});
```

</CodeGroup>

### Proxy API

If using the sdk on the client, create a proxy api which appends the key in the headers and then pass that endpoint into the `baseApiUrl` parameter. This prevents your key from being leaked while allowing you to set up the necessary protection in your proxy api.

```jsx
import {
  createClient,
  MAINNET_RELAY_API,
} from "@relayprotocol/relay-sdk";

createClient({
  baseApiUrl: "https://my-proxy.relay.link", //Replace with your proxy endpoint
  ...
  //other parameters
});
```
