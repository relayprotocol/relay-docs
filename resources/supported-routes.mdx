### How to find if a route is supported?

To find if a route is supported (we also sometimes say if a token is supported for bridging), you should use the [Chains API](https://api.relay.link/chains) to check if a route exists for a given token pair.

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.relay.link/chains"
```
The response will be a list of chains, each with a list of supported token pairs.

The way to check if a route is supported once you have the response is as follows:

1. Check for the `tokenSupport` field in the response for a give chain. If it is `All`, then all routes where the chain is origin or destination are supported for all tokens. 
2. If `tokenSupport` is `Limited`, then check for the `erc20Currencies` field in the response. The `erc20Currencies` field is an array of token objects each having metadata indicating if the token is supported for bridging or not.
3. Look for the `supportsBridging` field in the token object. If it is `true`, then the token is supported for bridging.
4. If `supportsBridging` is `false`or the token pair is not found in the `erc20Currencies` array, then the route is not supported.

Below is a dummy example response for Optimism chain and how to figure out if a route is supported for the token pair `ETH -> USDC`.

```json

        {
            "id": 10,

                "decimals": 18,
                "supportsBridging": true
            },
            "erc20Currencies": [
                {
                    "id": "wbtc",
                    "symbol": "WBTC",
                    "name": "Wrapped BTC",
                    "address": "0x68f180fcce6836688e9084f035309e29bf0a2095",
                    "decimals": 8,
                    "supportsBridging": false,

                    "surgeEnabled": false
                },
                {
                    "id": "usdt",
                    "symbol": "USDT",
                    "name": "Tether USD",
                    "address": "0x94b008aa00579c1307b0ef2c499ad98a8ce58e58",
                    "decimals": 6,
                    "supportsBridging": true,
                    "withdrawalFee": 0,
                    "depositFee": 0,
                    "surgeEnabled": false
                },
                {
                    "id": "dai",
                    "symbol": "DAI",
                    "name": "Dai Stablecoin",
                    "address": "0xda10009cbd5d07dd0cecc66161fc93d7c9000da1",
                    "decimals": 18,
                    "supportsBridging": false,
                    "withdrawalFee": 0,
                    "depositFee": 0,
                    "surgeEnabled": false
                },
                {
                    "id": "usdc",
                    "symbol": "USDC",
                    "name": "USD Coin",
                    "address": "0x0b2c639c533813f4aa9d7837caf62653d097ff85",
                    "decimals": 6,
                    "supportsBridging": true,
                    "supportsPermit": true,
                    "withdrawalFee": 0,
                    "depositFee": 0,
                    "surgeEnabled": false
                }
            ],
        }
  ]
}
```

As you can see, the `tokenSupport` field is `All`, so all routes for the chain are supported for all tokens.

Now, let us look at an example where `tokenSupport` is `Limited`.

```json 

        {
            "id": 7777777,
            "name": "zora",
            "displayName": "Zora",
            "tokenSupport": "Limited",
            "currency": {
                "id": "eth",
                "symbol": "ETH",
                "name": "Ether",
                "address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
                "decimals": 18,
                "supportsBridging": true
            },
            "erc20Currencies": [
                {
                    "id": "usdc",
                    "symbol": "USDzC",
                    "name": "USD Coin (Bridged from Ethereum)",
                    "address": "0xcccccccc7021b32ebb4e8c08314bd62f7c653ec4",
                    "decimals": 6,
                    "supportsBridging": true,
                    "withdrawalFee": 0,
                    "depositFee": 0,
                    "surgeEnabled": false
                }
            ],
        }
```

As you can see, the `tokenSupport` field is `Limited`, so only limited token routes would be supported and can be figured out by checking the `erc20Currencies` field.
The `erc20Currencies` field mentions that `usdc` is supported for bridging, so all routes where `usdc` is the origin or destination token for Zora would be supported.
