### How to check if a route is supported?

To determine if a route is supported (also referred to as whether a token is supported for bridging), use the [Chains API](https://api.relay.link/chains) to check for an available route between a given token pair.

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.relay.link/chains"
```

The response will return a list of chains, each containing supported token pairs. To verify if a route is supported, follow these steps:

1. Look for the `tokenSupport` field in the response for a given chain:
- If `tokenSupport` is `All`, then all routes involving this chain as either the origin or destination are supported for all tokens.
- If `tokenSupport` is `Limited`, proceed to step 2.

2. If `tokenSupport` is `Limited`, check the `erc20Currencies` field in the response. This field contains an array of token objects with metadata indicating whether a token supports bridging.

3. Locate the `supportsBridging` field in the token object:
- If `supportsBridging` is `true`, the token is supported for bridging.
- If `supportsBridging` is `false` or if the token pair is not listed in `erc20Currencies`, then the route is not supported.

### Examples of Supported and Limited Token Routes

**Example: All Tokens Supported**

```json
{
  "chains": [
        {
            "id": 10,
            "name": "optimism",
            "displayName": "Optimism",
            "tokenSupport": "All",
            "currency": {
                "id": "eth",
                "symbol": "ETH",
                "name": "Ether",
                "address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
                "decimals": 18,
                "supportsBridging": true
            },
            "erc20Currencies": [
                {
                    "id": "wbtc",
                    "symbol": "WBTC",
                    "name": "Wrapped BTC",
                    "address": "0x68f180fcce6836688e9084f035309e29bf0a2095",
                    "decimals": 8,
                    "supportsBridging": false,
                    "withdrawalFee": 0,
                    "depositFee": 0,
                    "surgeEnabled": false
                },
                {
                    "id": "usdt",
                    "symbol": "USDT",
                    "name": "Tether USD",
                    "address": "0x94b008aa00579c1307b0ef2c499ad98a8ce58e58",
                    "decimals": 6,
                    "supportsBridging": true,
                    "withdrawalFee": 0,
                    "depositFee": 0,
                    "surgeEnabled": false
                },
                {
                    "id": "dai",
                    "symbol": "DAI",
                    "name": "Dai Stablecoin",
                    "address": "0xda10009cbd5d07dd0cecc66161fc93d7c9000da1",
                    "decimals": 18,
                    "supportsBridging": false,
                    "withdrawalFee": 0,
                    "depositFee": 0,
                    "surgeEnabled": false
                },
                {
                    "id": "usdc",
                    "symbol": "USDC",
                    "name": "USD Coin",
                    "address": "0x0b2c639c533813f4aa9d7837caf62653d097ff85",
                    "decimals": 6,
                    "supportsBridging": true,
                    "supportsPermit": true,
                    "withdrawalFee": 0,
                    "depositFee": 0,
                    "surgeEnabled": false
                }
            ],
        }
  ]
}
```

Since the `tokenSupport` field is `All`, every token on this chain is supported for all routes.

**Example: Limited Token Support**

```json 

        {
            "id": 7777777,
            "name": "zora",
            "displayName": "Zora",
            "tokenSupport": "Limited",
            "currency": {
                "id": "eth",
                "symbol": "ETH",
                "name": "Ether",
                "address": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
                "decimals": 18,
                "supportsBridging": true
            },
            "erc20Currencies": [
                {
                    "id": "usdc",
                    "symbol": "USDzC",
                    "name": "USD Coin (Bridged from Ethereum)",
                    "address": "0xcccccccc7021b32ebb4e8c08314bd62f7c653ec4",
                    "decimals": 6,
                    "supportsBridging": true,
                    "withdrawalFee": 0,
                    "depositFee": 0,
                    "surgeEnabled": false
                }
            ],
        }
```

Here, `tokenSupport` is `Limited`, meaning only specific tokens can be bridged. In this case, `usdc` is listed under `erc20Currencies` with `supportsBridging: true`, so routes involving `usdc` as an origin or destination token on Zora are supported.
