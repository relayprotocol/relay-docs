### **How It Works**

All transactions are screened in real time against:

- **Third-Party Integrations**: Professional-grade sanctions and risk databases, including HackBounty and Chainalysis, used to identify addresses linked to malicious activity and ensure regulatory compliance.
- **Relay’s Internal Blocklist**: Continuously maintained and updated by our compliance team based on emerging threats and intelligence.

### **For Users**

If a transaction is flagged for involving a sanctioned address, it will be automatically blocked, and you’ll receive a “Detected sanctioned address” notification. This protects you and helps ensure full compliance with international financial regulations.

Through robust third-party integrations and internal safeguards, Relay maintains a secure and compliant environment for all users.
