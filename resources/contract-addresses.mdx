Relay's contract addresses can be found below along with each chain. This is current as of August
27th, 2024. For the most up to date list, please check our [Mainnet Chains API](https://api.relay.link/chains) or [Testnet Chains API](https://api.testnets.relay.link/chains).
We are currently in the process of getting all contracts verified and audited.

<Info>
  Please note that not all deployed contracts have the same address across all
  chains. Please check carefully to ensure you are using the correct contract
  address for the chain you are using.
