Relay is a cross-chain payments system that leverages third-party relayers for low-cost, low-latency cross-chain payments. When users wish to make cross-chain domain (bridging, minting, buying, arbitrary executions), they come to agreement with a relayer, who executes their wishes in exchange for payment on the desired chain.

## How it Works

This section describes how Relay works. We use the example of instant bridging here for simplicity:

### Initial Set up

In order to enable instant bridging, a trusted third party relayer (today Reservoir) locks capital in the Relay escrow contract on Ethereum Mainnet. For the sake of example, assume Reservoir has 10Eth locked, as well as having capital available to deploy on destination chains.

### Bridging Flow

1. Alice wishes to instant bridge 1 Eth from Mainnet to Zora

2. The app calls the Relay API to get a quote for instant bridging from Reservoir, The quote is returned with the rate, fees, and expected time for destination chain confirmation

3. Alice agrees to the quote, and Reservoir publishes their intent to fulfill the quote to Relay, with a corresponding order id.

4. Alice submits a transfer tx (1 Eth) to the solver _directly_ with the order id appended in the tx calldata. The tx is indexed by Relay as an instant bridge initiation and triggers the assignment of 1 Eth of escrowed value in the Relay protocol to Alice (this is her assurance that she will receive either her desired outcome or a refund).

5. The relayer pays Alice 1 Eth minus fees on Zora. The payment is indexed by Relay, when confirmed, reassigns the 1 Eth escrow balance from Alice to Reservoir.

### Cross-chain balances & withdrawals

Users may hold Relay protocol balance. This may occur in two scenarios:

- Alice wishes to hold cross-chain balance to easily (and more cheaply) execute cross-chain actions
- Alice attempts a just-in-time cross-chain action that fails, in which case she is left with cross chain balance

In the case that Alice holds cross-chain balance, it can be used in _any_ Relay action as a payment method, or withdrawn to Alice's wallet.

## Further Decentralization

The core team will be releasing a protocol whitepaper shortly.
