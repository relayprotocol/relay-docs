title: What is Relay?
description: "The fastest and cheapest way to bridge & transact across chains"
---

Relay is the instant payment network making transacting across chains as fast, cheap, and simple as online payments. We're pioneering "multichain payments" — a unified system for moving value anywhere onchain with no friction, no chain switching, and no technical guesswork.

Since launching in 2024, Relay has served **5M+ users**, processed **50M+ transactions**, and moved **$6B+ in volume** across **75+ networks**. On Ethereum alone, we route an average of 3 transactions every block, representing nearly 0.7% of all network activity.

## The Complete Stack

Built as a full-stack solution for every layer of the multichain payments experience:

### Relay App

**For everyone who wants to swap tokens across chains**

The fastest way to go from any token to any token across chains. Swap ETH on Ethereum for SOL on Solana in one transaction — built on the same infrastructure that powers enterprise customers.

### Relay API

**For developers building multichain experiences**

One integration, 75+ chains, zero complexity. Abstract the hardest parts of multichain development:

- **Bridge instantly** between chains with predictable fees
- **Swap seamlessly** using meta-aggregation across all major DEXs
- **Deliver payments-grade UX** with gas sponsorship, guaranteed rates, and SLAs

Whether you're building wallets, marketplaces, or consumer apps, Relay makes crosschain payments fast, reliable, and invisible.

### Relay Protocol

**The network powering it all**

The open system connecting users to relayers who execute onchain actions with maximum capital efficiency. Designed for low gas costs, rapid chain expansion, and enterprise-grade reliability.

## Payments-Grade Reliability

Unlike traditional bridges, Relay delivers the reliability users expect from modern payments:

- **99.9% uptime** across 75+ networks
- **Fast execution** instead of multi-minute wait times
- **Automatic redundancy** systems ensuring transactions complete
- **Clear completion signals** for apps and users

## Use Cases

Relay's flexible architecture supports diverse applications:

- [**Instant Bridging**](/use-cases/instant-bridging) — Move assets between chains in seconds
- [**Cross-Chain Execution**](/use-cases/cross-chain-execution) — Trade any token for any token across networks
- [**Chain Abstraction**](/use-cases/chain-abstraction) — Let users interact with apps without thinking about chains

## Trusted by Leading Teams

**Chain Expansion**: Alchemy, Conduit, and Caldera rely on Relay to provide payment rails to every rollup out of the box.

**Chain Abstraction**: OpenSea powers crosschain mints through Relay so collectors never worry about which chain they're on. Phantom collapses complex swaps into seamless flows.

**Multichain Infrastructure**: Apps like OneBalance route execution through Relay, letting users access opportunities across chains as easily as checking their balance.
