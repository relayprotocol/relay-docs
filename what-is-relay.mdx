title: What is Relay?
description: "The fastest and cheapest way to bridge & transact across chains"
---

Relay is a multichain payments network, designed to make swapping and transacting across 100s of chains delightfully simple. Since launching in 2024, Relay has served **5M users**, processed **50M transactions**, and driven **$5B+ in volume** across **85+ networks**.

It combines two core components:

- Instant low cost cross-chain intents, powered by the [Relay Protocol]()
- Comprehensive DEX Meta-Aggregation across 85 chains

This makes Relay a powerful solution for a diverse set of use cases:

## The Relay Stack

Built as a full-stack solution for every layer of the multichain payments experience:

### Relay App

**For everyone who wants to swap tokens across chains** - The fastest way to go from any token to any token across chains. Swap ETH on Ethereum for SOL on Solana in one transaction â€” built on the same infrastructure that powers enterprise customers.

[Try the App](https://relay.link/)

### Relay API

**For developers building multichain experiences** - One integration, 75+ chains, zero complexity. Abstract the hardest parts of multichain development:

- **Bridge instantly** between chains with predictable fees
- **Swap seamlessly** using meta-aggregation across all major DEXs
- **Deliver payments-grade UX** with gas sponsorship, guaranteed rates, and SLAs

Whether you're building wallets, marketplaces, or consumer apps, Relay makes crosschain payments fast, reliable, and invisible.

## Payments-Grade Reliability

Unlike traditional bridges, Relay delivers the reliability users expect from modern payments:

- **99.9% uptime** across 85+ networks
- **Fast execution** instead of multi-minute wait times
- **Automatic redundancy** systems ensuring transactions complete
- **Clear completion signals** for apps and users

## Trusted by Leading Teams

**Chain Expansion**: Alchemy, Conduit, and Caldera rely on Relay to provide payment rails to every rollup out of the box.

**Chain Abstraction**: OpenSea powers crosschain mints through Relay so collectors never worry about which chain they're on. Phantom collapses complex swaps into seamless flows.

**Multichain Infrastructure**: Apps like OneBalance route execution through Relay, letting users access opportunities across chains as easily as checking their balance.
