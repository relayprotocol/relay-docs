Relay enables instant bridging (deposits & withdrawals) on supported chains. Learn more about how it works, how to integrate Relay, and how to get your chain supported below.

## How it Works

Relay's instant bridging is powered by cross-chain relaying. This model results in low-cost, low-latency (1-10 seconds) cross-chain transactions. When a user wishes to bridge, they receive a quote from Relay that describes the time and cost of bridging. When they accept the quote, the order is validated and they submit a transfer directly to the relayer. The relayer then fulfills the bridge on the destination chain.

While the Relay Protocol is still in development, users rely on [Reservoir](https://reservoir.tools/) for order validation and relaying. Applications trust Reservoir to perform cross-chain relaying, and refund money in the case of disputes. The team will be releasing a fully decentralized and trustless protocol shortly, which you can learn more about in the [Relay Protocol Documentation](/how-it-works/relay-protocol)

## Integrating Instant Bridging

The Relay SDK facilitates interacting with the underlying Relay API. To get started make sure that you install and configure the [Relay SDK](https://docs.relay.link/references/sdk/getting-started). Ensure that everything is configured properly before moving on to implementing the getQuote and execute action.

```typescript Instant Bridge

import { getClient, Execute } from "@reservoir0x/relay-sdk";
import { createWalletClient, http } from 'viem'

...

wallet = createWalletClient({
  account: address,
  transport: http()
})

//In this example we're bridging from zora to base

const quote = await getClient()?.actions.getQuote({
  wallet,
  chainId: 7777777, // The chain id to bridge from
  toChainId: 8453, // The chain id to bridge to
  amount: '100000000000000000', // Amount in wei to bridge
  currency: '0x0000000000000000000000000000', // ERC20 Address
  toCurrency: '0x0000000000000000000000000000', // ERC20 Address
  recipient, // A valid address to send the funds to
})

await getClient()?.actions.execute({
  quote,
  wallet,
  onProgress: (steps, fees, currentStep, currentStepItem) => {
    console.log(steps, fees, currentStep, currentStepItem)
  }
})
```

## Adding Relay to Your Chain

Relay can easily be added to any EVM-chain, such as OP stack rollups, Arbitrum Orbit chains, or more. Please feel free to [Reach Out](mailto:support@relay.link) to discuss getting your chain supported today!
