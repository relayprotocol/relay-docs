Relay enables both same and cross-chain swaps on supported chains. We couple robust meta-aggregation of the best onchain swap providers with the low-cost and instant speed of the Relay Network deliever best-in-class any-to-any swaps on all our supported networks.

**Swap Meta-Aggregation** - We aggregated the best swap chain swap providers across crypto to deliever the best routes for onchain swaps

**Instant Cross-chain Swaps** - Relay's median bridge time is 2.7 seconds across chains.

**Multi-VM Support** - Relay Supports major EVM chains, as well as Bitcoin, Solana, Sui, Tron, Eclipse, and more.

**Gasless Support** - Relay supports gasless swaps via native support of 4337 account abstraction, 7702 support, and gasless permit execution (3009 and 2612)

**App Fees** - Our comprehensive approach to [App Fees]() lets you easily earn when using Relay. Additionally, we have designed our fee system for you to automatically collect fees in stables (USDC).

## How it Works

When a user wishes to swap, they receive a quote from Relay that describes the time and cost of swapping. When they accept the quote, the order is validated and they either excecute their same-chain swap (same-chain) or submit a deposit to the [Relay Depository Contract](/references/protocol/overview) (cross-chain), where a relayer then instantly fills the transaction on the destination chain before unlocking the funds on the origin.
