Relay supports cross-chain transaction execution for arbitrary cross-chain transactions. This means a user can execute any call on any chain and pay with any token on any other chain. This feature is perfect for cross-chain checkout experiences as well as full chain abstraction.

## How it Works

Relay's cross-chain execution is powered by cross-chain intents. This model results in low-cost, low-latency (1-10 seconds) cross-chain transactions. When a user wishes to perform a cross-chain action, they submit the call data to get a quote from relayers for execution. When they accept the quote, the order is validated and they submit a transfer to the [Relay Depository Contract](/references/protocol/overview). A relayer then instantly fills the transaction on the destination chain before unlocking the funds on the origin.
