Relay enables instant bridging (deposits & withdrawals) on supported chains. By coupling the instant cross-chain liquidity of the Relay Network with deep same-chain swap meta-aggregation, Relay enables instant onboarding and bridging of any token on any supported chain. There are several important features that make Relay onboarding great:

**Instant Cross-chain Onboarding** - Relay's median bridge time is 2.7 seconds across chains.

**Multi-VM Support** - Relay Supports major EVM chains, as well as Bitcoin, Solana, Sui, Tron, Eclipse, and more.

**Deposit Addresses** - Deposit Addresses allow users to onboard onto any chain via a transfer on any network. This makes it seemless for users to onboard from centralized exchanges or without connecting a wallet.

**App Fees** - Our comprehensive approach to [App Fees](/features/app-fees) lets you easily earn when using Relay. Additionally, we have designed our fee system for you to automatically collect fees in stables (USDC).

## How it Works

Relay's instant bridging is powered by cross-chain intents. This model results in low-cost, low-latency (next block) cross-chain transactions. When a user wishes to bridge, they receive a quote from Relay that describes the time and cost of bridging. When they accept the quote, the order is validated and they submit a transfer to the [Relay Depository Contract](/references/protocol/overview). A relayer then instantly fills the transaction on the destination chain before unlocking the funds on the origin.

Both Bridging and Onboarding can be integrated using Relay's Quote API:

**Bridiging** - Bridging across all supported networks and tokens can be integrated into wallets, apps, or any place a user may need to get funds onto a new network.

**Onboarding** - Onboarding users into a new wallet (or a new chain) can be done similarly to any bridging action, where the user specifies their destination account.
